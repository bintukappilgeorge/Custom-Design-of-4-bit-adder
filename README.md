- **Load:** 4 minimum-sized inverters per output  
- **Minimum NMOS Size:** WN = 300nm  
- **Performance Targets:**  
  - **Delay:** < 400ps  
  - **Area:** < 150¬µm¬≤  
  - **Power:** < 100¬µW

## üèó **Design Approach**  

- A **1-bit full adder** was designed and optimized at the **transistor level**.  
- A **4-bit adder** was constructed by cascading four **1-bit full adders**.  
- Logic gates were designed with **appropriate transistor sizing** to balance **power and delay**.  
- **No additional scaling** was required, as the design met the required delay constraints.

## üñ• **Schematic and Transistor Sizing**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Full Adder Schematic**  
- The **1-bit adder schematic** includes XOR, AND, and inverter gates.  
- The **4-bit adder schematic** is implemented using a ripple-carry architecture.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Transistor Sizing**  
- The width-to-length ratio (W/L) of all transistors was chosen to balance performance and power.  
- **Minimum NMOS size used**: **WN = 300nm**  
- **WP was adjusted** to match **LH and HL delays** across all logic gates.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Layout Design**  
- **Single-bit adder layout** and **full 4-bit adder layout** were designed.  
- Layout verification was conducted using **DRC and LVS checks**.  

---

## üî¨ **Simulation Results**  

### ‚úÖ **Worst-Case Delay**  
- Measured **worst-case delay** between **A0 and S3**: **52.3ps**  

### ‚ö° **Power Consumption**  
- Average power consumption: **68.6 ¬µW**  

---

## ‚úÖ **DRC and LVS Verification**  

### üìè **Layout & DRC Check**  
- **1-bit adder and 4-bit adder layouts** were designed.  
- **DRC (Design Rule Check) passed** for both layouts.  

### üîç **LVS Check**  
- **LVS (Layout vs. Schematic) passed**, confirming the correctness of the layout.  

---

## üìä **Final Score**  

The **performance score** was computed using the formula:

```
Score = (400ps / Delay) + (100¬µW / Power) + (150¬µm¬≤ / Area)
```

```
Score = (400ps / 52.3ps) + (100¬µW / 68.6¬µW) + (150¬µm¬≤ / 43.8¬µm¬≤)
```

```
Final Score = 12.5
```
